# MedAssist Chat Bot

>The MedAssist is a proof of concept chat bot that seeks to diagnose diseases based on patient symptoms. This bot is a form of AI that is able to interact with people naturally, augment decision making, and is scalable. It is originally intended to be able reach out to those in rural communities where there are greater challenges to access, quality and affordability. However, this has potential for a greater reach. This project was initiated by two other colleagues, each of us implementing a different ML model in an effort to determine the highest accuracy prediction. Ultimately, IBM Watson Studio was used to create multiple ML pipelines. IBM Watson Studio was used primarily for the sake of a learning process to understand and implement cognitive systems. The pipeline with the greatest accuracy was called through an API to predict the most likely disease from symptoms identified through IBM Watson Assistant. The IBM Watson Assistant was created by us to be able to identify symptoms from naturally spoken language by the patient/user. A demo can be offered upon request to offer a more comprehensive understanding.
